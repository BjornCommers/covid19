My observational analysis using the New York Times's covid19 dataset

MOTIVATION:
This project was mostly an opportunity for me to further hone my python pandas skills while also further educating myself about the fast-moving data around covid19.

FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
"primary_notebook" is where I'll put my main analysis. The few other notebooks that might be in the directory can be ignored.

HOW TO INTERACT:
It will be necessary to download the most up-to-date data from the NYT website. From there, the primary notebook can simply be run
and the associated graphs will be displayed. I have created additional columns such that the dataset provides a more robust picture
regarding new cases/deaths and how long the virus has been present in any given location.
